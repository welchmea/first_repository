Practicing how to set up a GitHub repository 

# My name is Meagan Welch

This is my first foray into GitHub. 

I am **ecstatic** at the possibilites within this platform

Here are three things about me:
1. I am a current student seeking a Bachelor's Degree in Computer Science.
2. I am a curious person and I love learning, as there is always potential in the unknown.
3. I should be living in the mountains.
